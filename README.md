# DSA_CAPSTON-PROJECT-Amazon-File_Documentation

Excel-based analysis of 1,465 e-commerce products with pivot tables and dashboard visualization with actionable insights for product improvement and marketing strategy derived from customer reviews and pricing data.

## 📖 Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### 🔭 Project Overview
This Data analysis project aims to  provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. By analysing the various parameters; product and consumer review data etc in the data received we seek to gather enough information to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. 

### ✍️ Dataset Description
- **Source**: The primary source of data used for this analysis is from Amazon product pages, including:
   - Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings 
   - Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content 
   - Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values 
     - Total Records: 1,465 
     - TotalFields: 16 columns

 ### 🧰 Tools Used
   1. Data Cleaning (Microsoft Excel Power Query)
       - Handled repeated product id column
       - Standardized product categories (e.g. Computers & Accessories, Home & Kitchen, Health & Personal Care, Care & Motorbike, Toys & Games etc)
       - created caalculated columns
   2. Analysis (Pivot Tables, Conditional Formating & Formulae)
   3. Dashboard Development (Excel Charts, Slicers)
      - Interactive Filters: Category, Price Range, Rating
      - Key Visualizations:
      - Discount impacts on sales volume (Scatter plot)
      - Category Performance heatmap (rating vs discount %)
   4. Documentation: Github Markdown

### 🧑‍🔬 Methodology 
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, the following actions were performed;
   - ⏳ **Data Acquisition and inspection:** The data was loaded and the total number of records and fields were confirmed to be the same from the source.
   - 🧹 **Data cleaning and formating:** An assumption that no product should have more than a record since its all about reviews and ratings was made and hence all duplicated product_id were were removed. Standardized product categories were created from the main category of product given becuase it is a multi-level category. The filter tool was used to validate each column's values.
   - 🔄 **Data Transformation:** Some Calculated columns were formed (e.g Total Potential Revenue, Discounted price, % Discount bucket, Price Range etc) before the dataset was turned to  table by applying ctrl+T.
   - 📊 **Analysis & Modeling:** Pivot tables and the calculated coulmn formed were used to analyse and answer the business questions.
   - 📉 **Visualization:** Built interactive charts and conditional formatting were used to present the answers.
   - 📑 **Reporting**: Insights were compiled into a dashbord with actionable reccomendation.

### 💹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The key business questions were answered through structured analysis pivot table architecture.
- Average Discount % by product category: Pivot Table (Rows `n product category, values `n Avg Discount)
- Products Listed by Category: Pivot Table [ Rows `n category, values `n Product (count)]
- High discount Flag = If([Discount]>=50, "Yes","No"), COUNTIF
- Average actual price vs the discounted price by category: Discounted price % was calculated using =((Actual price-Discount price)/Discount price)*100. Pivot Table (Rows `n product category, values `n Avg Actual price and Avg Discounted price)
- Discount Impact: Line chart with treadline
- Price Sensitivity: Bucketized analysis using formular; =IF(Discounted price<200,"<₹200",IF(OR(Discounted price=200,Discounted price<=500),"₹200 - ₹500",">₹500"))
- Product Rating and Review: Pivot tble with clculated column (Average rating+(Rating count/1000)). A scale factor of 1000 was used to balance the weight.

   Pivot Table showing the Total Potential revenue

  Electronics category alone contributes 91,323 million (80.3% total potential revenue). This indicates that Electronics is the core revenue driver. Heavy reliance on Electronics poses a significant risk. Any downturn in this category would drastically affect overall revenue.

Pivot Table showing number of unique products per price range bucket.
  - 62.9% of products priced >₹500. This alligns with revenue data where Electronics (avg ₹10,418) drove 80% of revenue. This indicates strategic focus on high-value segments.
  - Only 25.3% in ₹200-₹500 range. There is optimal rating-to-price ratio (4.2⭐ avg vs 3.8⭐ for ₹500)
  - <₹200 products represent just 11.8% despite the high-volume potential.

11. Relationship between ratings and level of discounts:
    Engagement peaks at moderate and high discounts as shown in the line graphs in the dashboard section (no 7). The highest number of reviews (27,979) occurs in the 61-70% discount range. The second highest is at 21-30% (24,334) reviews. *Ratings does not linearly increase with discount.* Instaed, we see peaks at 21-30% and 61-70% discount. This shows customers distrust extreme discounts.

12. **310 Products** have fewer thn 1000 reviews while 1041 products have greater than 1000 reviews. This shows significant low-engagement(reviews). Nearly 1 in 4 products (23%) struggle with review generation. Low review is not discount-driven because Toy & Games product category have 0% discounts yet 36% low review. Products with <1,000 reviews show **Lower average ratings** (3.4⭐) vs high-review products (4.3⭐).
   
13. There is extreme discounting in Tech Categories: Computers & Accesories (94%), Electronics (91%), and Home & Kitchen (90%) have the highest discounts, all above 90%. This suggests aggressive discounting strategies in these categories, possibly due to high competition, rapid obsolescence (for electronics), or overstocking.
